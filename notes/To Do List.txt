TO DO | Look into palette expansion wobble effect by updateing the palette width and height in correct order. (Decided against this)
TO DO | Reduce point_in_rectangle code for grid as as been done with palette
TO DO | The bug with extra border line is caused by initial creation code. This can be fixed by duplicating the expand palette code.
TO DO | Button status code should be programmed so that it takes data from a list or ds maps as to determine which variables should be used.
