TO DO | Look into palette expansion wobble effect by updating the palette width and height in correct order. (Decided against this)
TO DO | Reduce point in rectangle code for grid as with palette. (Complete)
TO DO | The bug with extra border line is caused by the initial creation code. This can be fixed by duplicating the expand palette code. Fixed
TO DO | Rebase git source control as some commit comments are incorrect.
TO DO | Look into constants.
TO DO | Palette expand code now fully works but would be nice to find a way to make the code more symmetrical. (Complete)
TO DO | Go through comments to ensure spelling grammar and consistency.(Ongoing)
TO DO | See if the sticky array can be removed.(No)
TO DO | Improve zoom code. (Complete)
TO DO | Look in to making grid the same border size regardless of size.
TO DO | Look over all bugs and ensure their validity.(Ongoing)
TO DO | Default stuck positions need to be set correctly. 
TO DO | Look into converting step based variable updates to on-demand code (Better as it is)
TO DO | Look at x and y max variables and see if they can be improved. (Complete)
TO DO | See if some of the case statements in action script can be condenced. (No point as assigning variables to array will cost as much code as before and going by sequential numbers is poor codeing)
TO DO | Fix scale placemnt code for when grid lines are thicker than one (Line thickness code has been  removed in favor of better scaling option)
TO DO | When clicking tiles on palette does not always play correct sound. Can't recreate step by step.
TO DO | Checks sprite tessellation.
TO DO | Put danger layer on different layer to collide layer. Use layer ID to swap current layer to avoid duplicate code.
